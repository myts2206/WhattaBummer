            <h3>Should analyis be priorotized?</h3>
            <p>Problems? They are meant to be there everywhere. Sometimes it gets hard to solve them. I get tensed up
                and freak the fuck out if a problem is not solved. The fear of not being able to solve the problem
                demotivates me constantly. Does analysis play a key role here? Does approaching a problem in various
                ways really help?Does thinking about it straight and back really help? Does analysis help me find a way
                to tackle the problem in a easier way?</p>

                <h3>Day 1</h3>
                <h4>Goldilocks Rule</h4>
                <p>It is the act of staying motivated. How exactly do you stay motivated?
                    Imagine a situation where you play tennis. You are asked to play tennis with a four year old. What
                    happens here? You win every point and you get bored after say 5 or 10 shots.
                    Now imagine having to play with a professional tennis player. You play against Serena Williams and
                    hardly win a point. Here too you tend to get demotivated and in a while you quit playing.
                    The trick here is to play with your equals. You win some points and you lose some. You stay
                    motivated
                    and end up playing more matches. Identify your equals and improve step by step.
